# Linear and Polynomial Regression
Code that performs Multivariate Linear regression and Polynomial regression.       
The following are each of the method's functions:    
q1_2: Finds rank of XT.X    
q1_3: Trains the model using multivariate linear regression and reports the performance on the test set    
q1_5: Plots MPG vs. horsepower    
q1_6: Finds the rank of XT.X for the carbig.csv dataset as a function of p where p ∈ {0,1,2,3,4,5} before and after centralizing the data    
q1_7: Constructs the design matrix X such that a single row looks like: [1 x1 x21 x31 ... xp1] where p ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and x1 is the centralized horsepower value of a particular car. Trains the model and then reports the performance on the test set    
q1_8: Constructs the design matrix such that a single row looks like: [1 x1 x21 x31 ... xp1 x2 x2 ... xp2] where x1 is the centralized horsepower value of a car and x2 is the centralized model year of a car and p ∈ {1, 2, 3}. Trains the model and then reports the performance on the test set
